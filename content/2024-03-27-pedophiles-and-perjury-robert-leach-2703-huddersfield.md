Before her demise from symptoms that could only have been caused by radiation poisoning (see below)
my wife gave a detailed account of her experience at the hands of officer Robert Leach 2703 Huddersfield.

She also left a series of pictorial messages, begining with our honeymoon in Scarborough where we
noticed Leach following us around and actively stalking her with sexual intent.

The holiday was ruined when (according to official sources) [Leach arranged a hoax bomb scare](https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/local-news/scarborough-bomb-scare-grand-hotel-21754783)
at the hotel where we had previously stayed in order to disrupt our festivities. 
We had moved to a different hotel by this time, however three hotels had to be evacuated, including the one we were at.
This photograph was taken on the train headed towards Scarborough, as she had discovered that the officer who had been pestering her 
had been asking peculiar questions

We also discovered that she had mysteriously become pregnant - yet had no memory of having intercourse during the months 
prior to our relationship. DNA taken from the foetus indicates that Leach was the origin.
Months later, she came to full recollection but did not disclose directly how the child had been conceived.
She had been sedated and molested whilst unconscious.

Around this time, she also began to show symptoms associated with radiation poisoning, including hair loss,
passing of copious amounts of blood, peeling skin and fingernails, yet with no detectable illness other than
a sudden drop in white cell count.

Her death was sudden and unexpected, since despite years of alchohol abuse her body remained unaffected.
On her last visit to the hospital, a cordon was put in place due to the nature of her symptoms.
No radioactive material was detected, however the damage to her organs was congnizant with that caused by
an internal dose of radiation.  On her way to a previous checkup, she had vomited pieces of necrotised
tissue, and undigested food, revealing to me the origin of the toxicity.


Thankfully she was largely unaffected by the illness, despite the fact
that most of her organs had died and were decaying.

She passed away very peacfully on the day which was to be our wedding.
