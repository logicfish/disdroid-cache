## Vile pervert Richard Tasker escapes jail

A few years ago, whilst visiting a bar where Tasker was manager, a friend informed me that he'd noticed a hidden network on their wifi.
Looking deeper, we found a hidden router. The location of the networking gear was highly suspicious - given that most of the cables
went upstairs, there was an ideal location for the gear in an alcove at the foot of the stairwell. However this stood empty.
Perhaps because it could easily be seen by anyone descending the stairs. They had chosen a very smelly old broom cupboard looking
into the female toilets. The routers had been packed away behind piles of cloth, and at first it seemed that there was only one
there - so where could this mysterious signal be coming from? Then we found that part of the wall had been hacked away, leaving
just enough space to hide a very small wifi router. However it was one of the ones where you can press a button and have the key
broadcast to every device in radius. So he proceeded to connect his phone and began to capture traffic.

When I next saw him, his face was green. He couldn't articulate. He kept looking at me, and nodding his head but no words came from him.
This detered me from further investigation, given that I have a long-term physical illness and could not risk a relapse.

It's not possible that this could have been hidden from staff and owners. Also, the pub had been freqented by devils such as Ian Watkins
from the band Lost Prophets, and strange groups of people who weren't known locally seemed to be coming and going at strange intervals.

Now we have a clue to the answer - the tip of the iceberg:

Why did the Examiner print this misleading article? He did not "spend christmas in jail".

He was spotted in the town center on Christmas Eve.
The Examiner is owned by Maxwell Group Press and freqently covers up for pedophiles, such as the judo coach who dragged a child into a ditch
and buggered him, after being cleared in court because reporters from The Examiner submitted character references causing the judge to 
dismiss earlier cases. The Examiner were triumphant, and published several articles such as this one:
