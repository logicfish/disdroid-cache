T﻿he letter received on 7/3/2023 states that council workers were "refused entry" on the 14th - except no workers visited on that day as is verifiable on CCTV. Mr Fisher had specifically remained at the property the whole day.

T﻿he only attempt Kirklees made to contact Mr Fisher beforehand was in the form of a brief letter stating that workers would attend on the 14th. No workers arrived at the property. 

What on earth could have become of them? Very strange activity has been noticed in this area, including the deaths of almost all the residents in the surrounding properties over a very short space of time!

### S﻿kivers - or cartel members?

W﻿ere they simply skiving? Or did they attend one of the "secret" meetings that go on in the seedy dens that the council laughingly refers to as an "estate"! How dare they!

O﻿ver several weeks last year, flocks of council vans had flooded the area, and appear to be making drop-offs of what could be drugs, or actual human beings. This activity quickly curtailed after being reported on our youtube channel.
