T﻿he letter shown states that council workers were "refused entry" on the 14th - except no workers visited on that day as is verifiable on CCTV.

### S﻿kivers - or cartel members?

W﻿ere they simply skiving? Or did they attend one of the "secret" meetings that go on in the seedy dens that the council laughingly refers to as an "estate"! How dare they!

O﻿ver several weeks last year, flocks of council vans had flooded the area, and appear to be making drop-offs of what could be drugs, or actual human beings. This activity quickly curtailed after being reported on our youtube channel.
