This letter was received on 28/12/2022.

It looks like a repeat of the fiasco we had in Marsden, where a
colleague of mine had rescued an alsation from an abuse gang
who then tried to destroy the animal using leverage in the police
and courts.

## This forms part of a harassment campaign enacted by pedophile actors inside kirklees council

The dog is little more than a pup, and is completely harmless.
However, I can see how this might be seen as a problem by the ring,
as they had earmarked the alley near my house for their activities.

## There is absolutely no evidence to their claims

Council vans have been spotted parked in odd places, at odd hours -
they have also been spotted making what appear to be drop-offs.
Probably drugs, but may include children, hence the need for the
larger vans.
