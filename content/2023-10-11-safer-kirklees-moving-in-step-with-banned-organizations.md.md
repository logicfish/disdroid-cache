Back in July, I received a mysterious visit from two individuals known to me as suspect members of a dark-web pedophile ring.

_Rewards paid for further information._

This happened after I [called them out over numerous bogus complaints](https://www.disdroid.co.uk/kirklees-council-cartel), instigated by a group on the terrorism watch list in connection with the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, who live in the same area.



The suspects retracted the letter that they had attempted to server, without their ID, and sent an updated version.
This contains numerous errors which will be highlighted in court when these crooks are brought to justice.

Attempting to censor my reporting on hard crime in the area!

No law in the land can prevent me from filming potential terrorist activities in the area, and I am free to post these wherever I wish.

Here is an example of a local resident confessing to being a child abuser, after kicking out at the dog.

Thankfully, I have a dangerous animals license and am legally peritted to keep any kind of animal whatsoever at my home. This is not in dispute. There are no instances of the dog being used "to intimidate or frighten people" - in fact these unsavoury characters are specifically targeting the animals, and in their discord server are films of small babies being devoured by large dogs, which are distributed as part of a large child abuse network.

Finally, the path in my front garden is NOT degnated as communal - it is for residents access only, and is not a meeting ground for drug parties!

As I have reported elsewhere, the alleyway was used during the planning of the Arena Bombing, and strange items have been spotted being conveyed along my front path to the flats behind.

There is no proper signature on this letter - it is improperly addressed and certainly will NOT stand in court!

Stay tuned.
