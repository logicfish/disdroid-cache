were raised by pedophile Carl Beech, who
had been previously been spotted spying around my home.

My arrest and capture was to prevent me discovering the "operation midland" because
I had previously wreaked revenge against a

the shoddy webserver (which had no password) and simply erased all the data on C:\ .
