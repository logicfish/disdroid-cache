Multiple reports from credible sources indicate that PC Robert Leach 2703 of Huddersfield is a predatory sex offender.

Here we see him acting strangely as he follows my wife around during a mental health episode.  The officer is later seen creeping around outside our home before sneaking behind the buildings to pop out at the door, imagining that he was avoiding the camera.

### Leach is implicated in a bloody battle inside an ambulance

During another episode, around the same time, she managed to cut an artery and had to be hospitalised as well as being arrested.
As the ambulance began to leave he leapt into the back and positioned himself alongside her.
Outside, we could hear her begin to yell, saying "let go of my hair" and "rape! he's trying to rape me!". 

### Reaching into her handbag, she found that the officer had taken her rape alarm.

Officer Leach had grabbed her by the throat, pulling her partly over and pinning her with his bodyweight whilst attempting to remove her clothing. During the struggle he deliberately tore away her bandage and manipulated her bleeding arm so that fountains of blood fell around her breasts and groin area, saturating her clothes and covering the floor of the ambulance. 

He repeatedly tried to grab at her breasts and groin, and received multiple blows as a result. Despite my wife's weakness from loss of blood she was still able to fend off the rogue officer who had taken it upon himself to conduct this brutal assault.

In this case unfortunately, charges were dropped by CPS despite a rake of evidence.

### This is the third victim who has come forward

As usual, cash rewards are available for any information that contributes towards his conviction.
