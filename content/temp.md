> The Times said that the spy worked for Beijing's Ministry of State Security and used a series of false names.
> The MI5 has previously warned that spies are using LinkedIn to target those with access to confidential information.

> A parliamentary report also warned that the aim was sometimes to lure people to China and then compromise them.
> The alleged spy is said to have used several names over a period of five years. The most prominent used was Robin Zhang,
> During that time it is claimed he offered British and other officials business opportunities, with an endgame of gaining sensitive information from them.
> He is also said to have offered a recruitment consultant up to £8,000 each time they handed over details of someone who worked for the intelligence services.
> Some of the targets were said to have been offered trips to China and paid speaking engagements.
> Others were asked to provide reports, which the alleged spy would then use to request more confidential documents with the aim of entrapment.

> In 2021, Britain's domestic security service MI5 said at least 10,000 UK nationals had been contacted by fake profiles linked to hostile states in the previous five years.
"Malicious profiles" are being used on "an industrial scale", said the security service's head, Ken McCallum. The service launched a Think Before You Link campaign about the risks.

> A Times investigation reveals that ‘Robin Zhang’ has been offering cash and contracts on an industrial scale for at least five years

> Zhang contacted officials working in sensitive areas, such as the military, science and technology and politics, to try to build relationships. He offered a recruitment consultant £8,000 for every time they handed over details of a candidate from the intelligence services, and offered a former military intelligence official large sums of cash for information on Britain’s counterterrorism work. Other targets were told they could have all-expenses paid trips to China and a slot on lucrative conference circuits.
> Zhang’s real identity cannot be published because it would place the identities of western spies at risk. However, The Times has been told that his main pseudonyms are Zhang, Eric Chen Yixi, Robin Cao, Lincoln Lam, John Lee and Eric Kim. He claimed to be linked to security companies based in Shanghai and used stock images or photographs of innocent people for his online profiles.

[Chinese spies ‘used LinkedIn to lure me to Hong Kong’](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/08/23/chinese-spies-linkedin-lure-gawain-towler-ukip-hong-kong/)

> A former spin doctor for Nigel Farage has claimed Chinese spies used LinkedIn to lure him to Hong Kong as part of a years-long effort to recruit British turncoats.
> Gawain Towler, a former spokesman for the UK Independence Party and then the Brexit Party, said Beijing’s spies had offered him thousands of euros in used banknotes as they flew him to the former British colony.
> The revelation comes after The Times unmasked a network of fake LinkedIn accounts operated by Chinese intelligence and used to target Britons.

Custom devices were given to targets for them to share data with China

> Mr Towler said that in 2018 he arrived at a Hong Kong hotel selected by his online contacts. He said his Chinese handlers offered him a mobile phone with a pre-installed espionage app for sharing confidential documents through Instagram.
> “Inside that app, I could take a photograph of a document and that document could then be inserted in a photograph that I would put on Instagram,” Mr Towler said.
> The document-bearing photo could then be downloaded from Instagram and its sensitive contents extracted by Chinese agents, he said.
Mr Towler informed the security services of what happened on his return to London.
